# Photogrammetry - Data Collection tutorial
Created by Jack Biggs

## What is photogrammetry?
* At its simplest, photogrammetry is the creation of a 3D model in digital space from multiple photographs of an object, interior or exterior space, or person
* Photogrammetric software takes these images and stitches them together to create a model that replicates the subject’s shape, color, and texture

## What is photogrammetry?
* Data capture is relatively easy and cheap given the right circumstances
  * Processing software is not usually free but is readily available in the DHI Lab for any Anthropology Dept. faculty, graduate student, or undergrad
* Digital preservation/curation of fragile materials that may disappear or break down over time
* Scaled photogrammetric models can be exported in a number of file types and loaded into different modeling or statistical software for quantitative analyses 
  * Ability to have data easily available without having the object right in front of you
* Creates a more interactive and tangible experience with an object compared to just an image
  * Easily share models and embed them into presentations

## What are the data used in photogrammetry?
* Contrary to what you might think, the 3D models are not the actual data, but the visualizations of the data
* The images you capture are the true data in photogrammetry and must be treated as such
 * Models are likely to be less accurate if the lighting and background setup and camera settings are not considered
 * The images are analogous to the rows, columns, or even individual cells in a spreadsheet of data – missing or miscalculated values can result in an inaccurate or skewed representation or analysis of those data

## Collecting the data (taking the photos)
Photos used in photogrammetry must be taken in a specific way and must meet a certain set of criteria:

**The number of photos** – there is no set number of photos required to create an accurate 3D model

* The number of photos will change depending on the size, shape, scale, and type of object you’ll be shooting

 * More than required is better than not enough – you can always disable or not use some images in the model-making process 

**Camera positioning and framing the object** – not all models will be of isolated objects, but can be of entire buildings, facades, or interior spaces (solitary objects are the focus for this series)

* This ties back in to the number of photos – having a portion of the object in only one image does not mean that it will get built into the model
 * Multiple shots of the object from multiple angles will increase the likelihood of getting a better model
 * When in doubt, take more photos than you think you should – you can always remove or disable unneeded photos during the model-building process

**Photograph overlap** - photos taken in sequence should overlap by at least 60% - if there is insufficient overlap, the model will not build correctly or at all (see both the above and below illustrations)
* Photo overlap is needed since photogrammetry software builds models based on points that if finds in multiple photos
 * This ensures that the software can identify those points in common and align them

**Passes or rotations of photos** – to get the best models more than one rotation or pass of photos around the object is required
* Rotations/passes allow for modeling software to interpret parts of an object that might be obscured in one rotation but not in another
* Separate rotations should be taken at different angles in relation to the object
 * Usually three is enough: one pass at or near eye-level with the object, one pass near 45°, and one pass at a steep angle (60°-70°)
 * A fourth pass is sometimes required – most useful when photographing objects with a visible interior that might not be adequately captured with three rotations/passes
  * This rotation should be taken almost at a top-down view
